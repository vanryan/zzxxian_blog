# Chapter 1 - Laughing at the Raven
The raven of Zurich, Felix Somary, foresaw the collapse of world economy.

- Felix Somary gave accurate prediction on the econ collapse. Well-trained economist with a rich practical experience as a banker and a political adviser.
- The Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, German Reparations, and Inter-allied War Debts 1921-1936 
- In late 1923, with the European powers stalemated over German reparations, the Reparation Commission formed a committee to review the situation. Headed by Charles G. Dawes (Chicago banker, former Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and future Vice President), the committee presented its proposal in April 1924. Under the Dawes Plan, Germany’s annual reparation payments would be reduced, increasing over time as its economy improved; the full amount to be paid, however, was left undetermined 
- In the autumn of 1928, another committee of experts was formed, this one to devise a final settlement of the German reparations problem. In 1929, the committee, under the chairmanship of Owen D. Young, the head of General Electric and a member of the Dawes committee, proposed a plan that reduced the total amount of reparations demanded of Germany to 121 billion gold marks, almost $29 billion, payable over 58 years.
- Germany ←[Charge Debts by reparation bills] – Europe –[pay debts]→ U.S
- Felix Somary warned that the Black Thursday in Wall Street and the insolvency of the 2nd largest Austrian and a primary Belgian bank is just the beginning of the downward spiral → international insolvency. The debtor countries’ agriculture and industries took interest rates too high for the short term loans (which prevented Germany from insolvency in the very short term), and the creditor banks would become insolvent because debtors couldn’t pay back.
- Franco-German cooperation was needed but never happened.
- How bad was it going?
	- 1929-32, world industrial production: -36%; didnt come back till 1937; unemployment >10%; prices of raw materials and manufactured goods: -56% and 36%; World trade: -⅔.
	- 1929-32 german industrial production: -50%
	- “The global economy broke up into several currency and trade blocs, bringing an end to an era of globalization”.
- Somary had knowledge, exp and instincts, but no ‘insider’ knowledge. He connected the dots.
By early 1930s, U.S. was the biggest creditor and Germany the biggest debtor. → inter-govermental chain of obligations
- The German Reich, the German state govs, municipalities, banks, and corps had borrowed huge amounts of private funds, especially from Wall Street → to finance economic expansion AND pay a large part of the reparations bill. 
- By 1929, debts owed to foreign banks (RM 31B) - ⅓ of German GDP. 86% if including reparation obligations. → a big chunk is SHORT-TERM (weeks or months).
- 1923 hyperinflation - Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic preceded the issues
- Weimar Germany -> a mortgaged democracy.
	- Needed public support to survive post-war years
	- Borrowing from abroad enabled the authorities to avoid unpopular tax increases, keep workers well paid and postpone the true costs of reconstruction
	- City mayors were launching big infra projects (concert halls, football stadiums,etc.) to boost VOTER loyalty
- One other reason for Germany’s borrowing: some officials in the German Foreign Ministry saw an advantage in accumulating commercial debt owed to US banks.
	- The more you borrow, the more leverage you have → you can threaten your creditors that you might default
Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann in a 1925 speech: “One must simply have enough debts; one must have so many debts that the creditor sees his own existence endangered if the debtor collapse..”
	- They also think → “The higher our private debt, the smaller our reparations”
- Germany's Economic status?
	- Weimar Germany was still Europe’s most power economy post-war, just recovering
War: 2 million soldiers German dead and 1 million German civilians dead. Danzig etc. to new Poland, Alsace-Lorraine to France.
But not economically/industrially crippled. Still the leaders in coal, iron, steel production, electrical eng, chemical industry, and car making.
	- 1924, restoring the gold-based German currency.
	- Lending to Germany
		- U.S., and all other countries
		-After Fed raised rates in 1928 to cool the stock market boom, lending to GER continued. When Somary was giving talks in Heidelberg in early 1930, US still lending short-term funds to GER
- Why policymakers were not able to stablize GER situation?
	- They were skeptical. They did not accept the premises of Somary.
	- Somary met Keynes in 1926, Somary was insulating his clients from coming crisis even then. But Keynes: “We will not have any more crashes in our time”
Somary: derided as `the raven of Zurich`
